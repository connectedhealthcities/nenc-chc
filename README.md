## SILVER Project: Smart Interventions for Local Vulnerable Families
One of Connected Health Citiesâ€™ major areas of interest in the North East and North Cumbria is the high risk user groups and vulnerable families. For example, children subject to a Child Protection Plan, adults and young people out of work/at risk of worklessness or at risk of financial exclusion, and families affected by a range of social and health problems such as anti-social behaviour, domestic violence and substance use.   The SILVER programme aims to explore how data linkages can be implemented to benefit these same populations.
